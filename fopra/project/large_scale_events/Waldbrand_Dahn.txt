The recent severe dryness in the upper soil layers is also noticeable in the number of operations of the Felsenland fire brigade. On Tuesday, the Dahn tank fire engine was called out again, namely for a forest fire between Pirmasens and Rodalben. There, together with numerous other TLFs from the entire area, it was supposed to ensure the water supply to the extinguishing units in a shuttle service. Approximately two hours after the TLF was requested, additional equipment and, in particular, personnel were required, which is why the Dahn fire department sent out the multi-purpose vehicle (MZF 3), loaded with forest fire equipment, and the personnel transport vehicle (MTF). The Bundenthal, Busenberg, Niederschlettenbach, Erlenbach and Ludwigswinkel units from the collective municipality were also deployed. For the Dahn unit, the operation in Rodalben ended at 4 a.m. the following day.
