Operational report
Our water fire brigade was called out on Tuesday, June 13th, 2023 to a forest fire between Pirmasens and Rodalben. A fire in around 17 hectares of forest was initially suspected on site. The task of part of the LZ-W was initially to provide water basins to fill the external tank of the requested police helicopter. Another part was deployed as a relief for firefighting on site. During the night, the LF KatS remained on site to keep watch on the fire. On Wednesday, June 14, 2023, forces from the LZ-W were requested again. A hose line around 1.2 km long was laid from two folding containers in the forest area in order to be able to extinguish further embers there. On the evening of June 14, our operation ended around 8 p.m. Our unit was thus on site for over 30 hours. The personnel were of course regularly rotated.

In addition to our unit and the requesting units of Pirmasens and Rodalben, numerous units from our district, two other districts (Germersheim and Südliche Weinstraße), the city of Zweibrücken (including Triwo) and the city and district of Kaiserslautern were deployed. In addition, the bomb disposal service and the THW were integrated into the operation to provide further support. At first, it was suspected that there were ammunition remnants in the fire area. Therefore, several SEG units from the district and the surrounding towns were alerted to set up emergency accommodation for surrounding residents in the Rodalben area. This was also necessary due to the enormous spread of smoke. In addition, several SEG units were tasked with providing food for the emergency services. For all advancing forces, a corresponding staging area was created in the area of ​​the Husterhöhe sports field and the THW building in Pirmasens, where the operations management and the catering point were also stationed.

In the coming days, there will be small embers to extinguish again and again. It will also take some time until all the clean-up work is completed.
