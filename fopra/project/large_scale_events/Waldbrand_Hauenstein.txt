Report: The Pirmasens fire department requested our forest fire kit on Tuesday afternoon for a forest fire between Pirmasens and Rodalben.

The TLF and the MZF 3 were assigned firefighting tasks in the upper area of ​​the site together with other fire departments.

Due to the fact that the fire continued to move towards military property, the forces were redeployed and built a 300-meter-long defense line on the edge of the military site with the circular sprinklers from the forest fire kit, so that an area of ​​5000 square meters could be kept wet with 40 liters of water per minute.

This measure was maintained for several hours. In the late evening we were able to dismantle the circular sprinklers again and were back at the site with both vehicles by midnight. The circular sprinklers were requested again at around 1 a.m. However, this operation was canceled after reconnaissance and consultation with the operations manager.
