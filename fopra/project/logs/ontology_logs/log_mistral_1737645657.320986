 On July 18, 2021 at 10:00 a.m., three active members of the Oppenheim Fire Department joined forces from the Rhein-Selz district and Mainz-Bingen district to provide disaster relief following the Ahr Valley flood. After assembling at the NÃ¼rburgring staging area, they proceeded to the local community of Schuld. Onsite, they assisted in ensuring basic protection and supported the installation of an emergency power supply and vehicle recovery from the Ahr. They also participated in a shuttle service to fill water tanks in remote locations.
In addition to on-site assistance, other forces from the Oppenheim Fire Department were ready to provide support at the situation center. For an entire week, comrades stood by to relieve the teams on site every 24 hours. However, the marching orders were subsequently revised daily, and no further forces from Oppenheim were deployed.
All forces who deployed shared special impressions of their experiences. They were most struck by the unprecedented friendliness with which they were received and cared for on site.
The Oppenheim Fire Department sends its support to everyone affected during this difficult time, wishing them strength and all the best for the future!
