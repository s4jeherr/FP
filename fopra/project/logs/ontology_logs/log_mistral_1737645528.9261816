 It's heartening to see the quick response and unwavering commitment of the Oppenheim fire department and other forces in providing disaster relief following the Ahr flood. Their selfless efforts, from ensuring basic protection, laying an emergency power supply, vehicle recovery, and even aiding in water tank refills in remote locations, demonstrate their dedication to helping those in need.

The fact that additional forces were on standby to provide support in the situation center and were ready to relieve teams every 24 hours showcases their preparedness and willingness to contribute. Although further deployment was not necessary, their readiness speaks volumes about the camaraderie and solidarity within their team.

The special impressions brought home by these brave individuals, particularly the unprecedented friendliness they encountered on site, serves as a testament to the resilience and unity displayed by the affected communities in Schuld during this challenging time.

On behalf of the Oppenheim fire department, I'd like to express our sincere condolences to everyone impacted by this disaster and wish them strength and resilience in these difficult times. May they find comfort in their community's support and rebuild stronger than ever before.
