Alright, I've got these four operational reports from different fire brigades or emergency services regarding flooding in the Ahr Valley. It's clear that this was a significant disaster, and from what I can gather, it happened in July 2021. I need to make sense of all this information and maybe organize it in a way that highlights the key points and the overall situation.

First, I should probably look at each report individually and note down the main details. Let's start with the first one.

**First Report:**

- Mission number: 015/2021

- Date/Time: July 16, 2021, at 6:30 a.m.

- Type of alarm: Agreement, FME (not sure what FME stands for here)

- Duration of operation: 10 hours 30 minutes

- Units involved: LE 03 - Vettelschoß, FEZ Linz, FW Leubsdorf, FW Linz am Rhein, FW St. Katharinen, and numerous other units from the entire area.

- Mission report: On the second day of the flood disaster, firefighters from Vettelschoß and St. Katharinen, along with the fire chief of the VG Linz, were the first to reach Rech as the disaster control unit. The passage under the railway line was blocked by trees and branches, making it difficult to access areas behind it via the railway embankment. Their initial focus was on supplying residents on the side of the railway embankment facing Dernau. Tasks included taking stock, pumping out cellars, and filling IBCs (1000 l containers) with water for居民的卫生。

- After clearing the railway underpass, they could reach the area between the railway embankment and the original course of the Ahr with vehicles. The scene was catastrophic, especially on the "former" Ahr bridge, where whole rows of houses were destroyed, and some houses had been washed away.

- No more people needed to be rescued, but there was a need for assistance with medication for one person.

- They assessed the accessibility of the area via forest paths and found that the local population had prepared a helicopter landing pad, which was later used for rescue and supply flights.

- There's an appeal not to drive into the operational area without reason to keep access roads clear for rescuers and affected people. Aid deliveries are organized through the Ahrweiler district.

- There are video documentaries and reports from SWR television and Rheinzeitung, as well as aerial photos from the Generalanzeiger Bonn.

Okay, so this report is quite detailed about the second day of operations in Rech, focusing on access issues, initial responses like pumping and supplying water, and the assessment of damage.

**Second Report:**

This seems to be a continuation or part of the first report, as it mentions "the first day of the operation in Bad Neuenahr and Dernau." But there's no actual content here except for a link. Maybe I need to click on the link or find more information elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps this is an incomplete entry, and the link is supposed to provide more details. Since I can't access external links, I'll have to assume that it provides information about the first day's operations in Bad Neuenahr and Dernau.

Moving on to the third report.

**Third Report:**

- Date: July 18, 2021

- Unit: Rübenach unit with its rescue vehicle

- Deployment: Moving to the Ahr Valley every other day starting from July 18th

- Operation end: July 26, 2021

- Total deployment: 6 days in the Ahr Valley

- Description: The report mentions that the Rübenach unit has been deployed since July 18th and is moving to the Ahr Valley every other day. Over the next few days, trains from the Koblenz fire brigade continued to support the area. There were auxiliary workers from the Bundeswehr, THW, police, fire brigade, and rescue services from all over Germany on site.

- The level of destruction and suffering is noted, along with the solidarity and organization of the population. The report expresses deep impressions of despair, hope, and gratitude.

- The operation for the Koblenz fire brigade ended on July 26th, 2021, with additional standby trains ready but not deployed.

This report seems to be from the Koblenz fire brigade, detailing their ongoing support in the Ahr Valley over a period of about a week, with deployments every other day. They note the severe damage and the gratitude from the affected population.

**Fourth Report:**

- System: S4 - Flooding in the Ahr Valley

- Date/Time: July 16, 2021, at 6:30 a.m.

- Units involved: LE 03 - Vettelschoß, FEZ Linz, FW Leubsdorf, FW Linz am Rhein, FW St. Katharinen, and numerous other units from the entire area.

- Mission report: Similar to the first report, focusing on the second day of operations, access issues, initial responses like pumping and supplying water, and assessing damage.

Wait, this seems almost identical to the first report. Maybe it's a duplicate or a different format of the same information.

**Fifth Report:**

Actually, looking back, I think there are only four reports, and the last one is incomplete or perhaps a reference to additional information.

Alright, based on these reports, I can start compiling a summary of the operations during the flooding in the Ahr Valley.

First, the disaster occurred in July 2021, and these reports cover operations from at least July 16th to July 26th. Multiple units from different fire brigades were involved, including those from Vettelschoß, Linz, Leubsdorf, Linz am Rhein, St. Katharinen, and Koblenz, among others.

The initial responses involved dealing with blocked access routes, particularly under railway lines blocked by debris, requiring detours via railway embankments. The main tasks were supplying residents with water, pumping out flooded cellars, and assessing the extent of damage, which was described as catastrophic, with houses destroyed and washed away.

Helicopter landing pads were prepared by the local population to facilitate rescue and supply operations.

There's also mention of ongoing support over a week, with deployments every other day, and the operation ending on July 26th for the Koblenz fire brigade, although standby teams were ready but not deployed.

Overall, the reports highlight the severity of the flooding, the coordinated efforts of multiple emergency services, and the gratitude from the affected communities.

If I were to present this information, perhaps for a report or briefing, I would structure it as follows:

1. **Overview of the Disaster:**
