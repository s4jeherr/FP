3. Fortunate rescue efforts were conducted, and a carrying aid for a person requiring medication was needed. The local population prepared a helicopter landing pad for rescue and supply flights.
4. Fire chief Thomas Nelles drove a detour to assess the accessibility of the area via forest paths and ensure that the few access roads and paths remained clear for rescue workers and those affected.
