Analyze the provided report and generate a JSON summary that strictly adheres to the following schema:

{
  "operationDetails": {
    "operationID": "string (unique identifier)",
    "operationName": "string (name of operation)",
    "disasterType": "string (type of disaster)",
    "dateTime": "string (ISO 8601 UTC format, e.g., 2023-01-23T10:15:30Z)",
    "duration": "number (in hours, optional)",
    "location": "string (operation location)"
  },
  "resources": [
    "string (list of resources used)"
  ],
  "tasks": [
    {
      "name": "string (task name)",
      "description": "string (optional, brief task details)",
      "startTime": "string (ISO 8601 UTC, optional)",
      "endTime": "string (ISO 8601 UTC, optional)",
      "location": "string (task location, optional)"
    }
  ],
  "observations": {
    "challenges": [
      "string (list of challenges encountered, optional)"
    ],
    "successes": [
      "string (list of successful outcomes, optional)"
    ]
  },
  "externalSupport": {
    "agencies": [
      "string (list of supporting agencies, optional)"
    ]
  }
}
Instructions:
1. Extract relevant details from the report and format them exactly as specified.
2. Ensure all date and time values strictly follow the ISO 8601 UTC format (e.g., 2023-01-23T10:15:30Z).
3. The fields observations and external support are optional. If no information exists for these fields, leave them out entirely.
4. Every Report requires and operationID. Use the date and operation name to create a unique identifier.
5. Leave out any attributes where you cannot find values for. For example if a task has no clear start or endTime, leave out the attribute entirely instead of inputting an empty string (for example don't do "startTime": "").
6. Every report should have at least one task, but can have multiple.
7. Your response must be a valid JSON object with no additional text, explanation, or formatting artifacts. As such, the first character you output should always be an opening bracket '{' and the last character a closing bracket '}'.
