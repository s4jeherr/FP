Craft an ontology to represent the themes and structure of the following operational reports from various fire departments. Focus on identifying similarities, recurring concepts, and overarching themes to create a model that can categorize and represent the information effectively.
Guidelines:
1.	You will be presented with multiple operational reports that may vary in structure and content. Your goal is to analyze the reports and derive an ontology that captures key concepts and their relationships.
2.      The reports in the provided example will all be about the same general disaster, but keep in mind that the ontology should be able to cover various other fire department work as well.
2.	Use hierarchical relationships where appropriate (e.g., "is-a," "part-of").
3.	Ensure the ontology accounts for synonyms or alternate terms that may appear in different reports.
4.	Present the ontology in a formal and standardized format, such as a tree structure or JSON schema, suitable for easy interpretation and potential computational use.
5.	Clearly label categories, subcategories, and relationships to enhance clarity and usability.
