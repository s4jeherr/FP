Deployment as part of the Ahr Valley disaster relief
July 18, 2021, 10:00 a.m.
Oppenheim / SCHULD - On July 18, three active members of the Oppenheim fire department set out together with other forces from the Rhein-Selz district and the Mainz-Bingen district to take action as part of the disaster relief effort following the devastating Ahr flood. After the column reached the NÃ¼rburgring staging area, it went from there to the local community of Schuld. On site, the forces helped to ensure basic protection. They also supported the laying of an emergency power supply and vehicle recovery from the Ahr. Finally, the fire engine also took part in the shuttle service to fill water tanks in more remote locations.
In addition to the on-site assistance, other forces from the Oppenheim fire department were on hand to provide support in the situation center. For the entire following week, comrades were found who were ready to march off to relieve the teams on site every 24 hours. However, the marching orders were subsequently revised on a daily basis and no further forces from Oppenheim were deployed.
All of the forces deployed brought home special impressions. They were most impressed by the unprecedented friendliness with which they were received and cared for on site.
The Oppenheim fire department wishes everyone affected a lot of strength in this difficult time and all the best for the future!
