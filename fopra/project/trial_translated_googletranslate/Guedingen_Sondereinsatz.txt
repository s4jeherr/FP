Operation report:
This Sunday, the route of the Germany Tour led through Güdingen and the district of Brebach, for which we have also been responsible for some time. Due to the large-scale route closures, an operational readiness unit was installed in the fire station in accordance with the operational plan. This meant that a squad (6 FA) was immediately available for any operations.

During the readiness period, we visited all junctions and route posts and exchanged information with the police and the security posts so that we could familiarize ourselves with the special traffic situations in the event of an operation. At lunchtime, the emergency team went to a restaurant in Güdingen and fortified themselves for the next few hours.

We took up position at the Globus roundabout for the main race of the Deutschland Tour and cheered on the racing cyclists. Our mission ended at around 5:45 p.m.
