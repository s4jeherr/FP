On Tuesday, July 23, 2024, the Kaiserslautern Integrated Control Center was notified of a tractor fire in the area "next to the highway" in the early hours of the morning. The dispatchers' detailed query made it possible to determine the "Hinterer Rothenberg" area. Since this area is clearly visible from the A6 motorway, several emergency calls came in almost simultaneously.

The professional fire brigade, which arrived shortly afterwards, did not find a tractor, but did find around 15 round bales of straw that were on fire. Due to the weather conditions and the fact that the risks were easy to calculate, the head of operations, Jörg Tremmel, decided to let the round bales that were fully ablaze burn down in a controlled manner. The wheat field next to it was protected from the spread of fire with water. The burning material was pulled apart using a tractor with a front loader to enable complete combustion.

In addition to the professional fire brigade, 15 members of the volunteer fire brigade were also deployed, some directly at the scene of the incident, but also to ensure operational readiness at the main fire station.

At around 8:00 a.m., Sandra Jung, who was the on-site operations manager at the time, was able to report "fire out".

The criminal investigation department has begun investigations because arson cannot be ruled out.
