Chimney fire / fire inspection
October 27, 2024, 8:39 p.m.
OPPENHEIM - At around 8:40 p.m., the Oppenheim fire department was alerted to a chimney fire. Previously, heavy smoke had been emitted from a chimney, whereupon a resident of the house had already escaped outside before the fire department arrived. She had previously attempted to extinguish the fire. When the command vehicle arrived, no more smoke could be detected. Only a slight smell of fire was noticeable. For safety's sake, the residents of the house were presented to the emergency services present. The external chimney was checked by a HLF crew from the basket of the turntable ladder, but no fire was found. After cross-ventilating the house and a final inspection of the interior, the scene of the incident could be handed back to the resident. A tank fire engine and a fire engine were on standby on site. Also on site were the management service and management support of the Rhein-Selz fire department, as well as the police.
