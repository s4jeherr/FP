Storm in Rhineland-Palatinate: Major deployment of fire brigades and emergency services
Published May 21, 2024 · Updated July 24, 2024

On Friday, May 17, 2024, there were severe storms with heavy rain in Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland and northern Baden-Württemberg in the evening hours. The city of Zweibrücken was particularly badly affected, with many areas flooded. Several streets were without electricity, residents were evacuated and housed in emergency shelters.

To provide support, the Kaiserslautern Integrated Control Center was commissioned by the Supervisory and Service Directorate in Trier to organize emergency services. In consultation between the city of Kaiserslautern, the districts of Kaiserslautern, Kusel and the Donnersberg district, fire brigade units were mobilized to help in the affected areas.

The first unit left the yard of the Kaiserslautern fire station late Friday evening and drove to Waldfischbach-Burgalben to use the largest available pump to protect the sewage treatment plant there from flooding and total failure. This operation lasted until Sunday evening.

From Saturday morning to Sunday evening, the state specialist unit PuMA, a unit from Kaiserslautern specializing in press and media work, was deployed in Zweibrücken. Among others, the Prime Minister, the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of the Environment were brought to the particularly affected areas to get an idea of ​​the situation.

Also from Saturday morning, around 25 emergency personnel from the volunteer fire department of the city and district of Kaiserslautern were deployed in Zweibrücken with special vehicles to support the local emergency services. Together with other forces from Mainz, Ingelheim, the THW from Stuttgart and the local fire departments, many millions of liters of water were pumped out. The operation at the Nardini Hospital, which was also affected by the floods, was particularly important. A quick and targeted operation prevented the hospital from being evacuated.

The crew of the Christoph 66 rescue helicopter was also supported by the fire department. Three young canoeists who had got into trouble on the Saar were able to get themselves to safety, but the next time an emergency was reported, emergency doctors and high-altitude rescuers from the Kaiserslautern professional fire department had to abseil down to a patient.

On Sunday, too, units from the alert area of ​​the Kaiserslautern Integrated Control Center were deployed in the worst-affected areas. Fire engines from the Donnersberg district and the Kaiserslautern district drove to Zweibrücken, while emergency services from the Kusel district helped in Konz on the Moselle. The forces on standby from the city of Kaiserslautern were no longer needed on Sunday.

This weekend once again showed that the motto "One for all, all for one" is still alive in the fire department, or rather in the entire emergency services family. We would like to thank all emergency services who helped the people on site.
