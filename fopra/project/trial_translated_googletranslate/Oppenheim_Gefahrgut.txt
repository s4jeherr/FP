OPPENHEIM - A technical defect on a garbage truck led to a fire department callout in the Oppenheim suburb at 10:50 a.m. Hydraulic oil was leaking from the vehicle. After the spread was stopped by the fire department, the site was handed over to the garbage truck crew, who took care of further measures themselves. Kautzbrunnenweg had to be closed briefly for the duration of the measures.
