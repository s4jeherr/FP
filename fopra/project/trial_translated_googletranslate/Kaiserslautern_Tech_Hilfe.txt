On Tuesday morning, July 24, 2024 at around 4:40 a.m., a serious accident occurred on the L367 near the northern industrial area. In the head-on collision between a truck and a car, the driver of the car was trapped in the wreckage of his vehicle and was so seriously injured that he was no longer alive when the first rescue workers arrived. As a result of the collision, the truck, which was loaded with fruit, broke through the guardrail, tipped over at the end of the approximately 8-meter-high embankment and remained lying on its side. The driver, who was trapped in the cab but not trapped, was freed by the fire department and handed over to the emergency services.

In addition to the Kaiserslautern professional fire department, the volunteer fire departments from Rodenbach, Siegelbach and Erfenbach were also called to the accident site to reconstruct the exact course of events of the tragic accident. The L367 was still completely closed at 12:00 p.m. because the recovery of the truck had not yet been completed.
