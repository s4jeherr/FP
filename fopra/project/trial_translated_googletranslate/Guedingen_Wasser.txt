As a result of the heavy rainfall the day before, a not inconsiderable amount of water entered the basement of a residential commercial building. In several places in the basement, several centimeters of surface water that was not draining away were still present.
The problem was quickly remedied with the help of the water vacuum. The site was then handed over to the owner.
