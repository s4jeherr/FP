Operation report:
Early Friday morning there was a hazardous materials accident on one of the loading ramps of a Güdingen shipping company. On site, a 200 liter barrel filled with hazardous materials fell over and completely leaked out.

After an emergency decontamination was set up, an investigation was carried out using respiratory protection. The danger and extent of the damage were assessed as being under control and the measures were determined accordingly. Applying a binding agent was sufficient to prevent damage. There were no other dangers, so a waste disposal company can now take care of proper disposal. Measurements taken also remained within safe ranges. No one was injured during the operation. The site was handed over to the company management.
