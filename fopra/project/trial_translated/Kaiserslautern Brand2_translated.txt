On Tuesday, July 23, 2024, the integrated control center Kaiserslautern was reported in the early morning hours of a tractor fire in the area "next to the highway". The "Hinterer Rothenberg" area was determined by the detailed query of the dispatchers. Since this area is easy to see from the BAB A6, several emergency calls almost simultaneously entered.

The fire brigade that arrived shortly afterwards did not find a tractor, but about 15 round bales straw that were on fire. Due to the weather and the fact that the risks were easy to calculate, the operations manager Jörg Tremmel decided to have the round bales in full fire burned down in a controlled manner. The wheat field next to it was protected from a fire with water. The brand was pulled apart by means of a tractor with a front loader to enable complete combustion.

In addition to the professional fire brigade, 15 forces from the volunteer fire brigade were also deployed, partly directly at the site, but also to ensure the operational readiness at the main fire station.

Around 8:00 a.m. Sandra Jung, who acted as head of operations, was able to report "fire".

The criminal police have investigated because arson cannot be excluded.
