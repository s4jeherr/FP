Shortly after 4:00 p.m. on July 27, 2024, the integrated control center in Kaiserslautern reached more than two dozen emergency calls from the eastern urban area within a very short time. The landing schedule quickly came to the conclusion that it was an apartment fire on the first floor of an apartment building. Since it could not be excluded whether there are still people in the four -storey residential building, in addition to four emergency vehicles from the professional fire brigade, a fire engine from the Kaiserslautern volunteer fire brigade were sent to the site. A comparison with the registration register showed that 15 people are registered in the building. On the basis of this information, the control center alerted several ambulances, a senior emergency doctor and an organizational manager for the emergency services to the site. The police were also informed, but had already posted patrol cars due to a large number of own emergency calls via the police call.

Shortly before the site, the initial ambulance reported, which had only a few hundred meters, that flames were beating out of a window on the first floor and the staircase of the building was smoky.

A fire -fighting attack by the fire brigade in the fire apartment and the parallel search for missing people in the stairwell and extensive ventilation measures showed a quick success. After just a few minutes it was clear that nobody was in the building and in the burning apartment. However, the fire apartment completely burned out. Other parts of the building were also affected, so that five people and a dog had to be temporarily accommodated by the regulatory office.

During the several hours of operation, the volunteer fire brigade of the city of Kaiserslautern ensured basic protection for the entire city area. The SWK was also in use.
