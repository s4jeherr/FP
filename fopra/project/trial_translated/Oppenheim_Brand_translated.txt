Oppenheim - At around 8:40 p.m., the Oppenheim fire department was alerted to a fireplace fire. Before that, there was a strong smoke development from a fireplace, whereupon a house resident had saved himself outdoors before the fire brigade arrived. Before that, she had attempted extinguishing. When the operating control car arrived, smoke development could no longer be determined. It was only easy to burn. The rescue service present was presented for security. The external fireplace was checked by a troop of the HLF from the basket of the turntable ladder, whereby no fire was determined. After cross ventilation of the house and a final control in the interior, the site could be handed over to the resident again. Tank fire truck and fire -fighting vehicle were available on site. The management service and management support of the Rhein-Selz fire brigade, as well as the police, were also on site.
