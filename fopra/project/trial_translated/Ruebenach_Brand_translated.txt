In Neugasse in the Metternich district, an outbuilding of an apartment building had caught fire. The fire blocked the way through the front door to the residents so that they could not leave the building. 4 people were saved over the aerial ladder and brought to safety. Several groups were used under respiratory protection for fire fighting, and the site was also illuminated. After the vehicles were cleared, the operation ended at 4:00 a.m.
