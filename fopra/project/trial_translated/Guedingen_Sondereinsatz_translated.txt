This Sunday, the route of the Germany tour through Güdingen and the Brebach district, for which we have also been responsible for some time. Due to the large -scale route closures, a operational readiness was installed in the tool shed in accordance with the operating plan. A season (6 Fa) was immediately available for any missions.


During the willingness we visited all the nodes and route posts and exchanged ourselves with the Poiien and the security post that we could familiarize ourselves with the special traffic situations.
