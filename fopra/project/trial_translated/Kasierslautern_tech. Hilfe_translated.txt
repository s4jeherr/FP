On Tuesday morning, July 24, 2024 at 4:40 a.m., there was a serious accident on the L367 at industrial area North. In the frontal collision between a truck and a car, the driver of the car was trapped in the ruins of his vehicle and was so seriously injured that he was no longer alive when the first rescue workers arrived. The truck loaded with fruits broke through the guardrail due to the collision, overturned at the end of the approximately 8 meter high embankment and remained on the side. The driver enclosed in the cab, but not trapped, was released by the fire brigade and handed over to the emergency services.

In addition to the Kaiserslautern professional fire brigade, the volunteer fire brigade from Rodenbach, Siegelbach and Erfenbach also worked for the accident, which occurred exactly on the border between the city and the Kaiserslautern district. An accident expert was called to the scene of the accident in order to reconstruct the exact course of the tragic accident. The L367 was still completely closed at 12:00 p.m. because the truck was not yet recovered.
