In a retirement home in the Metternich district, a 79-year-old demented resident had been graduated since around 6.30 p.m. Due to the frosty temperatures, there was an acute danger to life for the lady.
According to the nursing staff, the building was already searched. The rescue dog squadrons and the unit of leadership support from the Koblenz fire brigade were commissioned to search for people outdoors and in the vicinity. The rescue dogs and a drone with a thermal imaging camera were used.
Forces from the Rübenach fire brigade again searched the interior of the nursing home and found what they were looking for: the missing lady was found in a basement. It was handed over to the emergency services and taken care of in an emergency doctor. The assignment was over at around 0 a.m.
